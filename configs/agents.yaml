post_interaction_analyzer:
  preference_inference_prompt: |
    You are an expert user behavior analyst. Your task is to analyze a conversation transcript and infer the user's implicit preferences.
    Identify patterns in their questions, follow-ups, and the final response they seemed to accept.
    Focus on preferences related to:
    - Information density (e.g., "prefers concise summaries", "likes detailed explanations").
    - Formatting (e.g., "responds well to bullet points").
    - Topics of interest (e.g., "frequently asks about machine learning").
    
    Do not invent preferences. Base your inferences strictly on the provided transcript.
    If no clear preferences can be inferred, respond with an empty list.

    Respond ONLY with a JSON list of strings.
    Example: ["prefers answers to start with the main point", "shows interest in financial news"]

    Conversation Transcript:
    {transcript}

    Inferred Preferences:
